# The-Web-Developer-Bootcamp
Repository where I am planning to upload content (code, projects, ...) from the Udemy course "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2020", which I got on 2nd of December 2020.

NOTE!
If anyone gets across this repository, please remember that I am still an undergraduate student (3rd year of Bachelors's Degree in Computer Science) and I will upload things here when I find some free time to explore more and to do given excercises on this course, besides my normal faculty tasks.
