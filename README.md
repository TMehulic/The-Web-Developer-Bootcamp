# The-Web-Developer-Bootcamp
Repository where I am planning to upload content (code, projects, ...) from the Udemy course "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2020", which I got on 2nd of December 2020.

NOTE!
If anyone gets across this repository, please remember that I am still an undergraduate student (3rd year of Bachelors's Degree in Computer Science) and I will upload things here when I find some free time to explore more and to do given excercises on this course, besides my normal faculty tasks.

Even tho I am already familiar with most of the stuff mentioned and uploaded here (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), I want to cover this course completely from the first section to the last.
Reason for this decision is that I want to check if there are some things that I am maybe missing related to the things I already know.
Also I want to make sure I have learned everything correctly.

## December 10 2020
Finished HTML&CSS sections (except Bootstrap) and started JavaScript.
Since I am already familiar with most things, will not type any code until I get to Async JS.

## December 19 2020
Exams finished! Still managed to complete almost all of the JavaScript sections, got to the Async JS.
